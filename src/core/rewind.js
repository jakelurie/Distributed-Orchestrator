/**
 * Editing the past: removing a message from a session, and winding one back.
 *
 * Context is the product here. A transcript is re-sent in full on every turn, so
 * a message that took the work in a wrong direction keeps costing tokens and
 * keeps steering the model until it is actually gone. Hiding it in the UI would
 * not do that; these functions remove it from the events the providers see.
 *
 * Both operations have to preserve the one invariant every provider enforces:
 * a tool call and its result travel together. Removing an assistant message
 * therefore takes its tool results with it, and removing a tool result takes the
 * call that asked for it out of the assistant message. Anything else leaves a
 * transcript that the next send would reject.
